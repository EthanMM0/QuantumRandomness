#                                               Quantum Randomness

##                                   Based on my theory on quantum randomness

### This is all for educational and testing purposes not cryptographically secure and still not truly random YET!!

**##QuantumRandomness** 
is an experimental Python engine that simulates quantum-like randomness using evolving sub-engines, 
entropy sources, and delayed state resolution. Inspired by concepts of superposition, entanglement, and measurement collapse,
it produces values that only finalize when “observed” (pressing Enter).

**Key Features**

**Multiple Sub-Engines:** Each evolves independently with random math operations, symbolic encodings, and transformations.

**Observation Collapse:** Pending operations apply only when observed, mimicking quantum measurement.

**Environmental Context:** Adjustable gravity and temperature bias engine evolution (e.g., “vacuum” or “cold”).

**Entropy Sources:** Mixes system time, process/thread counts, OS randomness, and optional psutil stats.

**Single or Multi-Thread Mode:** Safe to run on laptops or thread-restricted environments.

**Human-Readable Tokens:** Observed values return as numeric tokens with optional symbolic prefixes.
